<h2>
  Construction industry
</h2>
<p>
  South Africa's building and construction sector promises to be at the forefront of the country's
  economic development as it is a sector that has the potential to employ a large number of people
  (at present, the sector employs about 260 000 people). Despite some slow periods, the industry
  has shown an overall trend of improvement since 2000.
</p>
<p>
  Although the sector is mainly made up of a few large companies, it has provided a number of
  empowerment opportunities. Various projects (such as those associated with the IDT) have been
  awarded to construction companies belonging to women and others matching empowerment
  criteria. At least 45% of building investment stems from residential sources.
</p>

<p>
  The development potential of the industry hinges on skills development. Many of those employed
  in the building and construction industry are unskilled and the training they receive through their
  work experience can result in them becoming semi-skilled or skilled workers.
</p>
<p>
  The construction of low cost housing is a significant feature of the building and construction
  industry as it allows for the participation of new role players and fulfills one of the South African
  government's main priorities, the rollout of essential services to all of South Africaâ€™s people.
</p>
<p>
  The expansion of this sector is closely tied in with levels of investment in the country, and
  impacts on a wide range of related sectors, such as cement, construction equipment and the
  specialist services associated with building and construction.
